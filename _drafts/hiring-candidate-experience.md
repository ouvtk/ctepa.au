title: "Candidate's interview experience"

There are many important parts to finalise a great hire - from having the right job description, and knowing exactly why do you want to hire this person - to understand what exactly to assess and what to look for. And eventually have a good onboarding.
Here I will only mention generic points to have experience of any interview process better - if you have those, it doesn't hurt, people will ignore the parts they don't need, but if you don't those you may be loosing candidates.

Over-communicate
Set expectations upfront at each step - ideally iterating your message multiple times. Creating a setting for each stage.
 
For the interview process - even if you don’t know exact number of steps, or ordering, or what are the steps, try to give as much information upfront as you have, so candidate knows what to expect.
 
For the phone calls - if you have more than the introductory one - explain that no preparation is needed, and that’s a conversation to explain about business and ask about past experience. Generally introductory phone call is always about it, so prep can be omitted.
 
For the interviews - explain what is going to happen and what preparation a candidate should have (or not have). For example, mentioning that this will be an interview to talk about your technical knowledge in the areas that mentioned in the job description. Or to talk behavioural questions, demonstrating values that align with the values of our company / team.
 
For the coding tasks - tell what setup is required upfront, give a choice of programming languages upfront (so there also can be an appropriate adjustments to setup). Inform if as part of this task you suppose to make it work (so testing and runtime environment should be part of the setup), or it is coding without really running the code, so it can be done even on a whiteboard if really needed.
 
Be quick
The quicker the turnaround, the higher the chance we leave a positive impression, the higher the chance to secure a candidate.
 
Be polite
Even if a candidate looks like a terrible fit, be graceful with how to finish the interview early. Easily can be that it was an unlucky coincidence that the candidate wasn’t able to demonstrate the real level of their abilities at this time - and we may hear from them again, or for other role. Even if it is not, we are all humans, be supportive.
 
Set back from the interruptions - failures - everything else quickly
