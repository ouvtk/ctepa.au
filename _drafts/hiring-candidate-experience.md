Job interviewing is a hard work for both sides.

Many important parts must come together to finalise a great hire:
 - having the right job description, 
 - knowing exactly why do you want to hire this person, - understanding what exactly to assess and what to look for. 
 - And eventually to have good onboarding.

I will mention a few generic points to make the experience of your interview process better. 

If you have those, it wouldn't hurt, people will ignore the parts they don't need. But if you miss some - you may be loosing good candidates.

# Over-communicate
Set expectations upfront at each step - ideally iterating your message multiple times. Creating a setting for each stage.
 
## For the interview process
Even if you don’t know the exact number of steps, or the exact ordering, or what are the steps themselves, try to give as much information upfront as you have now, so candidate knows what to expect. 

Some information is better than none, as long as it is accurate.
 
## For the phone calls
Introductory phone call is usually expected  (either with a recruiter or hiring manager). But if you have more than one - explain that no preparation is needed, and that’s a conversation to explain about business and ask about past experience.#
 
## For the interviews
Explain what is going to happen and what preparation a candidate should have (or not have). For example, mentioning that this will be an interview to talk about your technical knowledge in the areas that mentioned in the job description. Or to talk behavioural questions, demonstrating values that align with the values of our company / team.

## For the coding tasks
Tell upfront what setup is required. Give a choice of programming languages upfront (as setup may require adjustments). 

Explain what is expected as a result. Sometimes final solution has to work (therefore environment for testing and for the runtime itself should be part of the setup). Sometimes it is coding without really running the code (whiteboard excercise).
 
# Be quick
The quicker the turnaround, the higher the chance you leave a positive impression, the higher the chance to secure a candidate.
 
# Be polite
Even if a candidate looks like a terrible fit right now, it easily can be that it was an unlucky coincidence that the candidate wasn’t able to demonstrate the real level of their abilities at this time.
We may hear from them again, or they will be a great fit for other role. 

Even if it doesn't look like that, we are all humans, be supportive. If you need to finish interview early - be graceful, let the candidate ask questions they have and cover the areas they wanted.

# Expect missteps
Hiccups may happen both on your and on the candidate sides - fire alarm happened during the meeting, someone got sick, services you use for the interview got down.

Have a backup plan when possible.

And good luck
