# Don't disregard legacy code

I believe you only can gain certain experience while maintaing legacy software.
So it is not always needed to run for a green-field projects.

Problem is that not every legacy system is beneficial for your skills and sanity.

## What is legacy

The baseline definition of a legacy software is a software for a system that yet cannot be decomissioned, as it fulfills some critical need, but this system cannot be reasonably improved due to unsupported runtime, outdated environment, or some specific vendor or library lock-ins.

But you may often hear legacy much more often, as opposed to greenfield development.
That may include software which has:
 - no automated tests to make refactoring and support easier;
 - not enough documentation to describe its core functions, and design decisions;
 - no "original" engineers left, together with a knowledge of a system intricate details.
